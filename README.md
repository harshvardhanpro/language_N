# language_n
## (g++ should be installed on your pc)

Project for Hackathon Aug 2017 - Thapar University

'N' in its initial stage has these functionalities :

1. Variables and function declaration 
1.1 Data Types Supported (int, char) and arrays
2. Syntax is " " separated i.e, "space" without quotes
3. Display realtime errors if any in the console with highlighting line number

During compilation, our language interpretor parses and tokenises the N language code and using various expression checks and error handling, the N code is converted to the respective C++ code. This C++ code is then further compiled to finalise and execute our N code.

Steps:
1. Open command promt/terminal in the folder in which program is saved.
2. Now type "g++ compiler.cpp -o compiler". Press ENTER
3. Now after compilation type "compiler tic.n"
4. Play the TIC-TAC-TOE game. Enjoy !!
