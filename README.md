Project for Hackathon Aug 2017 - Thapar University

Welcome to the Language of your Dreams (Not Really) *** Language N ***

The language in its initial stage is built to handle these basic :

Variables and function declaration 1.1 Data Types (int, char)
Syntax is " " separated
Display realtime errors if any in the console with highlighting line number
During compilation, our language interpretor parses and tokenises the N language code and using various expression checks and error handling, the N code is converted to the respective C++ code. This C++ code is then further compiled to finalise and execute our N code.

Steps:
1. Open command promt/terminal in the folder in which program is saved.
2. Now type "g++ compiler.cpp -o compiler". Press ENTER
3. Now after compilation type "compiler tic.n"
4. Play the TIC-TAC-TOE game. Enjoy !!
